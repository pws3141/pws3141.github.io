This means the language around this topic can be somewhat confusing for a newcomer, as old terms are still floating around, and overlapping with newer more precise terms.\n\n\n\nA short history\nTODO:\n\nGregor Mendel: “recessive” and “dominant”\nThe birth of genetics: 1900 - 1940, basic patterns of genetic inheritance\nDNA (1940s and 50s), and the discovery of the double helix (Rosalind Franklin, James Watson and Francis Crick, 1953)\nBiobanks\nGWAS"
